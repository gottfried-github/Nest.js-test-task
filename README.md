## AdminJS
1. supports noSQL as well as relational dbs
2. has adapters for all major ORMs
3. has clear architecture
4. is easily exstensible
5. supports React
6. supports different REST frameworks
7. has good documentation
8. has a team of developers and many contributors

## Express Admin
1. only supports relational dbs
2. instead of adapters, is configured via a .json file
3. has an understandable pattern
4. is extensible through custom views
5. doesn't support React
6. only supports Express.js
7. has somewhat poor documentation
8. has not that many contributors

## Conclusions
I would choose AdminJS because it is well maintained and well documented, has a clear architecture, is easily extensible and supports React out of the box.
